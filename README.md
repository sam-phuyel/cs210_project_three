# cs210_project_three
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project demonstrate the usage of File I/O features of C++. It reads the texts from the file, process it, and output modified data. 
- What did you do particularly well?
- I have encapsulated all the data and functions in a Class, which helped me write clean code. 
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I could utilize other OOP features of C++ to make my program more robust. 
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I particularly find the part where I read from the file and writing modified text to another file challenging, but also gained valuable insight. 
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I will take with me the concepts of OOP. This will greatly help with in my journey to become a Software Developer. 
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I have use OOP concepts, comments and documentations to make this program maintainable, readable and adaptable.
