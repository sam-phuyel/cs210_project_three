# Project Summary

This project demonstrates the usage of File I/O features in C++. It involves reading text from a file, processing it, and outputting modified data.

## Key Achievements

- **Encapsulation**: All data and functions have been encapsulated within a class, resulting in clean code.

## Areas for Improvement

To make the code more robust, the following enhancements could be made:

- **Utilizing other object-oriented programming (OOP) features** of C++.
- Implementing additional error handling and input validation mechanisms.

## Challenging Code Sections

The most challenging part of the code was the file reading and writing operations. However, it provided valuable insights and learning experiences.

## Transferable Skills

The project has provided a solid foundation in **OOP concepts**, which can be applied to future projects and coursework. This knowledge will greatly benefit progress towards becoming a **Software Developer**.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To ensure the program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability, the following measures have been taken:

- Utilization of **OOP concepts**.
- Incorporation of **comments and documentation** throughout the codebase.
